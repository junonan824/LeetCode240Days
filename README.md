# String Algorithms

This repository contains two string manipulation algorithms implemented in Python:

1. `mergeAlternately`: Merges two strings by alternating characters from each string.
2. `gcdOfStrings`: Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strings, defined as the largest string that can divide both strings.

## Algorithms

### 1. mergeAlternately

This function takes two strings and merges them by alternating characters from each string.

#### Function Signature

```python
def mergeAlternately(word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
